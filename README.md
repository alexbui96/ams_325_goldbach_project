# ams_325_goldbach_project

There are two python files in this project.

The main project is goldbach.py, which has the main() function builtin.

The second file is sieve_runtime.py to compare the running time between sieve and other functions in Python.

To run, just use the Python interpeter.

In some analysis tasks, the results will be saved in the directory.
